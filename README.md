# Mail service application

As part of my Career Path program at the company I have been working at, my objective to reach the **middle level seniority** as a developer was to build a mail application.

## The repository is holding both the **server** and the **client** applications.

### server: Node project running an Express.js server (more details in the `/server/README.md`

### app: Client-side project running a React application (more details in the `/app/README.md`
